Subject: [fbsplash-devel] Compiling splashutils-1.5.4 on Fedora Core 6
Message-ID: <570912.28317.qm@web36607.mail.mud.yahoo.com>


The libraries are all existing on my system. During the make process, idid have to go and edit a few makefiles in libs and src - for somereason it was not picking up gcc as the compiler - had to manually addthat in to prevent the "-Os command not found" that make was throwingup.

Anyway, alls well that ends well....I was able to compile splashutils -now playing around with the idea of early boot. Verbose mode works asexpected but for some reason the progress bar does not show up insilent mode. Fixing that at the moment.

Thanks for the help.

Dips

You shouldn't do that.  These libs are meant to be compiled with klcc
and linked statically into the fbcondecor kernel helper.  Do you have the
static versions of libjpeg, libpng and other relevant libraries
installed on your system (check for /usr/lib/libjpeg.a, etc)?  If 
you don't, they will probably be provided by -static or -devel packages.

Please make sure you have the static libraries installed on your system.
Then start with a fresh splashutils source tree.  If you run into any
problems, run `make QUIET=false` and post the exact error message to
this list.

At any rate, do not manually configure and build the libraries from
splashutils/libs :)

Best regards.

Thanks for posting this, I'm sure people will find it useful :)

Perhaps you'd like to put the guide into the fbsplash wiki, so that it is
easier to find and to update?

If so, feel free to create a 'docs:distros:lfs' page on the wiki and 
link to it from http://fbsplash.berlios.de/wiki/doku.php?id=docs:distros

Best regards.

I notice you use the klibc distributed under the debian directory, so...: 
using the apt management tool itself, something like the following 
could/should do it:

cd /tmp
sudo apt-get build-dep splashutils (if you are not root already)
apt-get source splashutils
cd splashutils-1.5.4
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

If the apt-get build did not get my packaged klibc; then:

cd /tmp
sudo apt-get install klibc=1.5.7-4+2.6.23.kamikaze5
sudo apt-get build-dep splashutils (if you are not root already)
apt-get source splashutils
cd splashutils-1.5.4
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

Then you will have in your /tmp ready-to-installed splashutils packages. I do 
not know about how to configure apt on LFS though.

Cheers, JD.

Ahem... Or simply:

apt-get install splashutils

if you manage to install apt and configure properly on LFS.
