Subject: [fbsplash-devel] 1.5.4 release: early warning :)
Message-ID: <20080218164705.GA4017@spock.one.pl>

Hi everyone,

This is an "early warning" about the upcoming 1.5.4 release of
splashutils.  The release is planned for about a week from now,
unless some new bugs are found or I suddenly become swamped with
work.

The new version of splashutils will include the following features that
I think might require some slight updates of the distro-specific codes:

- Support for a <textbox> section in the theme config files.  Whether
  the textbox is visible by default is specified by the SPLASH_TEXTBOX
  variable, with a default value of "no".  This should probably be
  explicitly stated in whatever config file you're using for fbsplash.

- There is a single static binary instead of fbsplashd.static,
  splash_util.static and fbcondecor_ctl.static, which are now symlinks
  to this binary (so everything should work out of the box -- if it
  doesn't, please let me know).

- Support for a fbsplash message log.  The log is supposed to contain
  messages collected during boot.  Some generic support for it is
  provided by splash_svc() in splash-functions.sh.  If you're not
  using this, or wish to override it -- please update your scripts
  to support message logging.

Please also note that fbsplash supports the suspend/resume modes --
you should probably make use of these in case you also provide
scripts for interaction with any software suspend mechanisms.

The release will probably also include an 'autoverbose-on-inactivity'
patch by Michael Heide, which will add yet another configuration
variable.

As usual, the latest version of fbsplash is available at:
http://repo.or.cz/w/fbsplash.git

Best regards.

 - Add support for the fbsplash message log.

Subject: [fbsplash-devel] Compiling splashutils-1.5.4 on Fedora Core 6
Message-ID: <512924.64397.qm@web36611.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I am trying to compile splashutils on Fedora core 6. Downloaded the full tarball ran configure on it.

Successful so far. Ran make on it and thats when the problems started. It complained about libjpeg.a not being present.

Went into the libs dir and configured and compiled all of the libraries since each of those was giving an error.

Once the libs were all compiled, i went into the root dir for the sources and ran make again. This is what it turns up

make --silent all-recursive
Making all in libs
Making all in src
Making all in .
  CC      fbcondecor_helper-kernel.o
make[4]: DWITH_ERRLIST: Command not found
  CC      fbcondecor_helper-libfbsplash.o

  CC      fbcondecor_helper-libfbsplashrender.o

  LD      fbcondecor_helper

make[3]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[2]: *** [all] Error 2
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [all] Error 2

The same error turns up with splashutils-1.5.3. Any ideas on how to get it working on FC6? Help is much appreciated.

Thanks

You shouldn't do that.  These libs are meant to be compiled with klcc
and linked statically into the fbcondecor kernel helper.  Do you have the
static versions of libjpeg, libpng and other relevant libraries
installed on your system (check for /usr/lib/libjpeg.a, etc)?  If 
you don't, they will probably be provided by -static or -devel packages.

Please make sure you have the static libraries installed on your system.
Then start with a fresh splashutils source tree.  If you run into any
problems, run `make QUIET=false` and post the exact error message to
this list.

At any rate, do not manually configure and build the libraries from
splashutils/libs :)

Best regards.
