Subject: [fbsplash-devel] Problem with fbsplash on debian...
Message-ID: <1226588223.7628.12.camel@debian>

Hello!

I have a little problem with fbsplash on debian : since last update, at
the end of the loading process it seems that gdm is called too early.
The progress bar don't reach its end (stop by 98%) and the fade effect
don't reach its either (just breaked off, not very nice).
When I proceed to a theme test with :
splash_manager -c demo -t debian_neon -m s --steps=100
The test reach the end of the process.
Everything else works perfectly.

regards

Jean-Louis

May I know what is the run-order of gdm v.s. splash(utils) on your system ?

I guess that

ls -l /etc/rc*/*gdm* /etc/rc*/*splash*

can do it.

Thanks, Cheers, Jean-Damien.

Subject: [fbsplash-devel] splashutils-1.5.4.3 released
Message-ID: <5d9b736f0811141148paa9d4b9wb7cbf7694acb3402@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Just a quick note to let you know that I released splashutils-1.5.4.3 yesterday.
This release fixes some minor bugs, and __changes an existing interface__.

The change is that the svc_started and svc_stopped events have been
split into svc_started/svc_start_failed and svc_stopped/svc_stop_failed,
respectively.  svc_started and svc_stopped also no longer take error codes
as an argument.  This change was necessary to bring the OpenRC splash
plugin and the splash-functions.sh code into sync.

I decided to change the interface instead of fixing the OpenRC plugin to
provide imaginary error codes, as I believe there is very little point in
exposing the error code (which can easily vary across distros) in the
splash interface.

Some backwards compatibility fixup code is in place in splash-functions.sh,
so hopefully this change will not break any existing themes.  Also, AFAIR
none of the non-Gentoo splash scripts implement these events anyway,
so any impact is likely to be limited to Gentoo systems, where I can take
care of any problems myself.

This might also be a good moment to actually implement these service-related
events in the Debian and Arch scripts.  Please let me know if you are
interested or if you need any help with that.

Best regards,

Thank you for this announcement.

Concerning debian scripts, the (in theory, see [*]) actions are those defined 
in their generic splash API, and they can be only of the following types up 
to now:

splash_running()          # Detects whether a splash is running
splash_stop()             # Tells the splash to quit
splash_start()            # Tells the splash to start if not already running
custom_splash_progress()  # Tells the splash the current boot/shutdown
                          # progress
splash_start_indefinite() # Tells the splash that a task which may take an
                          # unknown amount of time has started (such as a
                          # fsck).
splash_stop_indefinite()  # Tells the splash that an indefinite task is done
splash_user_input()       # Gets user input from a splash

IMHO Gentoo distribution handles much more events - in particular the fact 
that a /named/ event is finished is terribly missing.

[*] To be more accurate we depend on what is really called, indeed we find 
that only the following events are currently used by the top debian rc 
script:

splash_progress()
splash_stop()

Yes, that's all, unless I misunderstood /etc/init.d/rc.

So unfortunately Debian splash support is, let'say, not at the Gentoo's level.

Thanks,

Regards, Jean-Damien.

Subject: [fbsplash-devel] Another little problem on debian lenny
Message-ID: <1226751446.8011.6.camel@debian>

Hello everyone !

I have found another little disturbing thing on my debian install. On
reboot, splash works ok until the very end of the process. Then falls to
console with the warming : "rebooting system". I didn't find anything
about this on internet...

Thanks for your works.

Jean-Louis Biasini

PS: Is there anyone working on a translation ? I can offer my help for
the french version...

Thanks for explaining the Debian splash API to us.  Do you think it would
be (technically) possible it to extend it to include those service-oriented
events (svc_started, etc)?  By technically possible I mean:
- without having to modify every single initscript,
- regardless of whether a patch extending the interface would be accepted
  upstream or not.
