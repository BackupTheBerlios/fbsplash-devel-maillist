<PRE>
The libraries are all existing on my system. During the make process, idid have to go and edit a few makefiles in libs and src - for somereason it was not picking up gcc as the compiler - had to manually addthat in to prevent the &quot;-Os command not found&quot; that make was throwingup.

Anyway, alls well that ends well....I was able to compile splashutils -now playing around with the idea of early boot. Verbose mode works asexpected but for some reason the progress bar does not show up insilent mode. Fixing that at the moment.

Thanks for the help.

Hi,

You shouldn't do that.  These libs are meant to be compiled with klcc
and linked statically into the fbcondecor kernel helper.  Do you have the
static versions of libjpeg, libpng and other relevant libraries
installed on your system (check for /usr/lib/libjpeg.a, etc)?  If 
you don't, they will probably be provided by -static or -devel packages.
 
&gt;<i> The same error turns up with splashutils-1.5.3. Any ideas on how to get it working on FC6? Help is much appreciated.
</I>
Please make sure you have the static libraries installed on your system.
Then start with a fresh splashutils source tree.  If you run into any
problems, run `make QUIET=false` and post the exact error message to
this list.

At any rate, do not manually configure and build the libraries from
splashutils/libs :)

Best regards.
