<PRE>Hi everyone,

This is an &quot;early warning&quot; about the upcoming 1.5.4 release of
splashutils.  The release is planned for about a week from now,
unless some new bugs are found or I suddenly become swamped with
work.

The new version of splashutils will include the following features that
I think might require some slight updates of the distro-specific codes:

- Support for a &lt;textbox&gt; section in the theme config files.  Whether
  the textbox is visible by default is specified by the SPLASH_TEXTBOX
  variable, with a default value of &quot;no&quot;.  This should probably be
  explicitly stated in whatever config file you're using for fbsplash.

- There is a single static binary instead of fbsplashd.static,
  splash_util.static and fbcondecor_ctl.static, which are now symlinks
  to this binary (so everything should work out of the box -- if it
  doesn't, please let me know).

- Support for a fbsplash message log.  The log is supposed to contain
  messages collected during boot.  Some generic support for it is
  provided by splash_svc() in splash-functions.sh.  If you're not
  using this, or wish to override it -- please update your scripts
  to support message logging.

Please also note that fbsplash supports the suspend/resume modes --
you should probably make use of these in case you also provide
scripts for interaction with any software suspend mechanisms.

The release will probably also include an 'autoverbose-on-inactivity'
patch by Michael Heide, which will add yet another configuration
variable.

As usual, the latest version of fbsplash is available at:

Best regards.
