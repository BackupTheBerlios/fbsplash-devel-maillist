Hello,

I am new to the list, my name is Iv?n, and I would like to contribute to
fbsplash by doing the man pages of the programs involved in the project.

Does anyone has started this job? If so, have you manage to finish it, can I
help?

I am proficient in English and Spanish languages.

Thank you and kudos to you all! :)

Hi,

As far as I know nobody has done manpages for fbsplash.

Thanks,
Michal
