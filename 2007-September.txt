Hi,

As promised, I had a look at your patches.  In general, things look
good and this is definitely the way to go :) There were a couple of
problems but I think I've got them fixed now.

The problems that I've hit:
 
- when building from the objs directory, the source code compiled with
  -DTARGET_KERNEL didn't use -I. and -I.., which caused it to fail
  with a 'config.h: No such file or directory' message

- the bundled libraries for the kernel helper have to be built (or at
  least configured) before compiling the kernel helper code (the order
  of dependencies was incorrect)

- the include paths (-I ...) for the different libraries (freetype,
  libpng, etc) have to be used when compiling all source files, no only
  two from libfbsplashrender (this is perhaps something that I should
  fix in the source code itself)

- fbsplashd wasn't being linked with -lgpm

I'll do some more tests soon and also see whether there's any way to
reduce the number of configure options -- we seem to have an awfully
huge amount of them now :)  If all goes well, the patches should be
pushed into my git repo in a few days.

Thanks once again for working on this.

Best regards.
